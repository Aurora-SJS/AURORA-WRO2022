INTRODUCTION:

''''

ELECTROMECHANICAL COMPONENTS:
The Aurora bot is built using the Lego EV3 Mindstorm's robotics kit. The brief description of each electromechanical component (sesors, motors and bricks) used in building this robot are given as folllows in order to understand the code and functionality of each component better.

I.Sensors: 

1. ULTRASONIC SENSOR: The ultrasonic sensor is primarily used for the detection of obstacles and their avoidance. It is attached to the front of the robot.

2. COLOUR SENSOR: The colour sensors are used to detect change or for the comparison between two or more different colour. 2 colour sensors were used, 1 placed facing downwards and the other front faced.

3. GYRO SENSOR: The gyro sensor helps in detecting the rate of rotations by measuring the angles. It is placed in between the brick and the ultrasonioc sensor in our robot to assist it in rotations.

II.Motors:

1. LARGE MOTOR: the large motor is the primary driving base of our self driving robot.

2. MEDIUM MOTOR: the medium motor acts as a steering actuator in our robot.

III.Brick:

The EV3 Brick is the primary component of our robot. It supplies power to the robot and controls all its movements and actions. It is the part which stores all the programs neccessary for the functioning of the robot. It consists of 4 buttons, i.e power/OK button, off button, left and right, all of which help in assisting the robot in its movement.

CODING:

The programming platform used for the coding of the self driving robot is Lego Mindstorm Education EV3. Many programs were combined using My Block Builder.
